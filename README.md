# Poker Hands Detector

The Poker Hands Detector project is a software solution that utilizes computer vision and machine learning technologies to recognize and evaluate poker hands. This project provides an automated and objective way to determine the hierarchy of poker hands in a poker game, helping players better understand the value of their hands and make informed decisions.



## Key Features

- Automatic recognition of playing cards from images or video frames.
- Precise evaluation of poker hands according to the rules of the game.
- Use of a custom dataset to train the recognition model.
- Displaying recognition and evaluation results on images or video.
- Identifying the best hand from the given selection of cards.
- Extensibility for future features and improvements.

## How it works

The Poker Hands Detector project employs a pre-trained neural network model to recognize playing cards in images or video. After recognition, the implemented script applies the rules of the poker hand hierarchy to determine the hand's value. The results are displayed on the image or video, including the identified hand and the corresponding score.
## How to use

To use the Poker Hands Detector, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your computer.
2. Ensure that all necessary dependencies and libraries are installed.
3. Run the recognition script to start detecting and evaluating playing cards.
``` bash
cd '.\Poker Hand Project\'   
python .\PokerWebcam.py
```
